Filtering std::stream's through a program

#### IFilter

Problem: we have an istream. We want to read from this stream, not
directly but through some filter program.

```c++
IFilter flt(istr, prog); // run prog as a filter for stream istr
flt.stream() >> foo;     // read from filtered stream
```

```
istream -> [ program -> istream ] ->
           [ program -> istream ] ->
```

The filter program should exit when input data ends
(corresponding istream is not controlled by IFilter).
Destructor of IFilter just waits until it happens.

#### OFilter

Problem: we have an ostream. We want to write to this stream, not
directly but through some filter program.

```c++
OFilter flt(ostr, prog); // run prog as a filter for stream ostr
flt.stream() << foo;     // write to filtered stream
```

```
-> [ostream -> program ] -> ostream
-> [ostream -> program ]
```

The filter program should exit when input data ends. Destructor of
OFilter closes the stream (which is controlled by OFilter) and waits for
the child process.

#### IOFilter

Run a program and have access to its stdin and stdout:
```c++
IOFilter flt(prog); // run prog as a filter for stream ostr
flt.ostream() << foo;  // write to filtered stream
flt.close_input();     // close filter's input: we send what we wanted.
flt.stream() >> foo;   // read from filtered stream
```

```
-> [ostream -> program -> istream] ->
```

The filter program should exit when input data ends.
Destructor of IOFilter closes the stream and waits for the
child process. It is usually needed to close the filter input
stream without destroing IOFilter object (to finish reading from it).
This can be done with `close_input()` method.

### Timers

Somtimes it is needed to stop the filter program after a timeout. There
is a timer in IOFilter (later it will be added to other classes). Two
functions implemented:
```c++
filter.timer_start(int msec);
filter.timer_stop();
```

Both can be run in any order as many times as needed (they just reset
the timer counter). After the timer is expired the filter process is
terminated by SIGTERM signal.

### Known problems

If the filter process is killed, then pipes are left in bad condition
(???) and operations with iostreams (closing or distructing) fail. This
is always seen when you use timer, but it is not a timer-related issue.
